**Overview:**  
The Word Counter project aims to enhance your Python programming skills by building a program that counts the number of words in a given text input. You will gain experience with user input handling, string manipulation, function creation, control flow, and output display.

**Objectives:**
1. **Input Handling:** Learn to capture and manage user input.
2. **String Manipulation:** Utilize techniques to process and analyze text.
3. **Function Creation:** Develop modular code through function creation.
4. **Control Flow:** Implement basic control structures for logical flow.
5. **Output Display:** Present the word count in a clear format.

**Requirements and Features:**
1. **User Input:** Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
2. **Word Counting Logic:** Develop a function to count the words in the input.
3. **Output Display:** Print the word count to the console.
4. **Error Handling:** Manage potential issues such as empty input.
5. **Code Comments:** Comment the code to clarify its functionality.
6. **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure a straightforward and intuitive user experience.

**Steps to Achieve the Objectives:**

1. **Prompt User Input:** 
   - Use Pythonâ€™s `input()` function to get text from the user.

2. **Implement Word Counting Logic:**
   - Create a function `count_words(text)` that splits the input text into words and counts them.

3. **Display the Output:**
   - Use `print()` to display the total word count.

4. **Add Error Handling:**
   - Check if the input is empty and handle it appropriately.

5. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different code sections.

6. **Ensure User-Friendly Interaction:**
   - Ensure that prompts and outputs are clear and easy to understand.
